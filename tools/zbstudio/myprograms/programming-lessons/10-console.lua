# Interactive console

In addition to running the scripts, the tool that you are using right now provides you with another way to experiment with the code you are writing. It allows you to open a special window to run interactive commands. You can click on `Local console` tab at the bottom of this screen to switch to that window.

Now type `2+3` at the prompt (>), hit `Enter`, and you should see `5` as the output. [Click here](macro:shell(2+3)) if you have troubles finding the window or not sure how to do it and I will do it for you (just this time!). Now try `2+3*4`. Note that the result is `14`, because, as you have seen with the order of operation, the multiplication has the higher priority and is executed first, **before** the addition is done.

The console is a powerful tool as it allows you to execute **any** command you can use in the scripts. Try running commands you have learned so far.

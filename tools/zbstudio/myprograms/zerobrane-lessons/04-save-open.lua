# Saving and opening programs

To **save** a program you can press `Ctrl-S` or go to the `File | Save` menu at the top of the window. If the program does not have a name yet, you will be asked to provide a name for it. Pick a name that helps you (and others) recognize what the program does. As an example, the file that you are reading right now has the name `04-save-open` because it is about saving and opening files.

To **open** a program or file you have several choices: you can press `Ctrl-O`, go to the `File | Open` menu, or double click on the file name in the `Project` panel on the left (more about it on the [next](05-running.lua) page). The editor will open that file for you or will activate one of the existing pages if the file is already opened.

Try opening the `welcome` file using the `File | Open` menu. You can switch back to this page by clicking on its tab at the top of the window.

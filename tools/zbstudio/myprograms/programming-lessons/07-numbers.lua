# Numbers

Just as in any human language there is a way to express numbers, every programming language has a way of doing math with **numbers**. Each of the main math operations -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division -- has its equivalent in programming and a special symbol to use for it. You can use plus (+) for addition, minus (-) for subtraction, asterisk (*) for multiplication, and slash (/) for division. Let us do some math with these **operators**.

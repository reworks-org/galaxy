# Hello, World!

The very first program all future programmers create is called "Hello, World!". We will create it too by asking the computer to output "Hello, World!".

The text that you see below is the actual script that does that; [click here](macro:run), press `F6` on the keyboard, or click on `Project | Run` menu at the top to run the script. You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the `Output` section below. **Try it.**

Congratulations! You have made your first step as a computer programmer! Now modify the text and see how it works. You can type anything like "Hi, Andrey!" or "I did it". Do not forget to run the script again after changing it.

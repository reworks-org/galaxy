replace json with that.


switch asset panel to use loose in dev
 - so use physfs, and mount loose folders when in dev, and to use asset pack in release
 - use kuba/zip to export assets i.e. writing.
 - then only need physfs for reading.

- add support for miniaudios new fading api
- add support to writing to update archives
- add entity heirachy. i.e. u can attach entities to each other. This can then be saved as a prefab
	- scene heirarchy / scene tree thingy?
- refine exporting, asset config, etc.
- great blog: https://pvigier.github.io/2019/07/28/vagabond-2d-light-system.html

- test particle generator

Tilemap post processing:
???
	maps now no longer render tiles, rather we pre-render a scene -> animated tiles are different / separate objects.
		prerendering lets us to fancy lighting and stuff.
		i.e. create tilemap in tiled, then export to use as bg image.
		support layer visibility being toggled at runtime. not just when loading.
		handle serializing specific parts of map data.

fix no ambient light when no lights in scene
add instance rendering
more flexible renderer -> able to render arbitrary stuff by having some prebaked quads and stuff.
	 - implement b2_debugdraw?

- integrate camera controller

- add entity heirachy. i.e. u can attach entities to each other. This can then be saved as a prefab
	- scene heirarchy / scene tree thingy?

- stop using shared pointers...they are expensive.

Scripting:
- better https://github.com/skaarj1989/entt-meets-sol2/tree/main integration.
- refine Scripts to more easily "attachable" single use scripts or "trigger" scripts.

Tilemap:
- reenable in scene

editor stuff:

animation:
- Pre-buffering all render 2d data for animations. so we only update texture pointer instead of vertex data.
- need to wire up state management to input and animation in the ECS using messages/events?
	- maybe using lua?

- update rml to 5.0
	- need to test rml integration, maybe refer to official backend implementations.
	- support content scale (dpi thingy) for rml
	- make sure font dpi is working with the content scale.
- box2d
	- b2 units to engine units.
	- support circle colliders
	- support polygon colliders
	- use onconstruct/destruct to register for box2d -> add b2world to world class alongside registry.
	- physics materials
	- velocity iterations and position iterations need to be in editor
- mapping
	- https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/tileson
	- when adding mapping, add an animated tile component and then a map system that updates the animations, and batches them together into a batch stored in the system
		- then submit that to the renderer.
- state based system for character moevement + updating animation.
- need to verify font, ui and glfw window are handling "codepoints" correctly.
- need to make sure batch is a proper spritebatch...

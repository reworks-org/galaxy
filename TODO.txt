- support content scale (dpi thingy) for rml
	- make sure font dpi is working with the content scale.
- state based system for character moevement + updating animation.
- need to test rml integration, maybe refer to official backend implementations.
- need to verify font, ui and glfw window are handling "codepoints" correctly.
- need to make sure batch is a proper spritebatch...
- box2d collisions, integration, etc...
	- box2d conversion from in game units to pixels...
	- use onconstruct/destruct to register for box2d -> add b2world to world class alongside registry.
- standard sat based collisions or box2d with no gravity using cute_c2
- make sure json outputs are encoded
	- convert to base64 then zlib.
- mapping
	- https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite
	- https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/tileson
	- when adding mapping, add an animated tile component and then a map system that updates the animations, and batches them together into a batch stored in the system
		- then submit that to the renderer.

editor:
- https://github.com/SpartanJ/efsw
- have some kind of shader manager and allow drag/drop that name onto draw shader component
- resource selection should be dropdownlists...
- "import" i.e. copy to asset strcture
	- context menu
	- "create" buttons need to show validation message / notification.
	- delete entity.
- texture maanger for editor
- assets need to be imported into structure
	- and be per project?

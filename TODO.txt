scenemanager should have registry and pass to scenes.
systems might need to be scripted in.
    - might need to work out how to handle specific system groups such as UI -> menu ui system, game ui system, etc...
    -> could just use a tag... mainmenuui for mainmenusystem, but still uses same shared ui component.

map is an entity -> there is a mapsystem which controls mapdata and events. it will destroy any components on level change that arent marked persistent. it will be responsible for enabling/disabling
entities based on the current map, entites for the map such as maprender, map collision, etc would be toggleable. esp since a level is just a map.  
systems can subscribe to events -> such as map load / map unload, can then flag the update loop for this to happen (and reset flag). level data arent unique -> your main scene would have a map with different levels, and to communicate you would trigger a command (event) component that gets called once and disposed.
which would set player location to new level coords, and pop/push that maps entitys -> which you would verify by having a leveltag perhaps. or you would use a relationship component to control those subentities of i.e. the top level map parent entity. or flag them as a map enttiy anyway.

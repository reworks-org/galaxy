Resources are designed to be loaded up front. This is fine since we aren't using the level of assets of i.e. a 3D game. This is similar in style to how factorio loads its data.

A game will have a scene. This is usually for dividing up unrelated areas of the game - i.e. the root. Normally this would be divided into two - the menu, and the game itself.

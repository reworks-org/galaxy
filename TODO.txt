more drag/drop support for tree view, body, etc
add entity heirachy. i.e. u can attach entities to each other. This can then be saved as a prefab
	- scene heirarchy / scene tree thingy?

more flexible renderer -> able to render arbitrary stuff by having some prebaked quads and stuff.

implement b2_debugdraw?

parallaxx support

fix no ambient light when no lights in scene

https://github.com/albin-johansson/wanderer/tree/dev/source/wanderer/systems

TileMap:
	loading a map should generate prefabs and store them.
	we can then on the fly create new entities from these prefabs.
	I.e. load all data beforehand and just assign/copy into a component.
	worldspace/tilemap transitions/loadings separate from loader.
	add load screen when switching maps in scene.
	maps now no longer render tiles, rather we pre-render a scene -> animated tiles are different / separate objects.
		prerendering lets us to fancy lighting and stuff.
		i.e. create tilemap in tiled, then export to use as bg image.

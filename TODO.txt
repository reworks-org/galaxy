add entity heirachy. i.e. u can attach entities to each other. This can then be saved as a prefab

better editor play mode
more flexible renderer -> able to render arbitrary stuff by having some prebaked quads and stuff.

more drag/drop support for tree view, body, etc

TileMap:
	loading a map should generate prefabs and store them.
	we can then on the fly create new entities from these prefabs.
	I.e. load all data beforehand and just assign/copy into a component.
	worldspace/tilemap transitions/loadings separate from loader.
	add load screen when switching maps in scene.

Use github issues and pull requests.

Make sure your issues / pull requests decribe the problem you are having/trying to solve.

Use clang-format and some form of static code analysis before opening a pull request. CA configs are in repository root.

Open an issue that is correctly labelled and link it to your pull request, which is also correctly labelled.

Keep coding standard inline with modern `cmake` and `C++20` guidelines. Use `snake_case`, except for types and classes, which are `CamelCase`.

	-  in docs that when adding folder to the config file they must have a '/' on the end if they are folders.
	-  about objects and physics in tmxmap docs with name of object being script name.
	-  about entt destroying components and to not allocate memory using components
	-  in docs that when making text objects in map, text fontfamily and size must be in fontbook in format: fontfamilySize and that parse code will remove spaces first.
		- and size is pixelsize not pointsize
	- and about the layer for objects being explictitly specified in properites of layer.
	-  that the engine operates on degrees, but allegro draws in radians.
	-  about layerrs and tmx mpa
	-  aboutt physics objects only being created if layreri s named collision, also note that it doesnt matter where textrues and stuff in tmx path too because only the last file name in the path is used.
		- i.e. if in tmx map the path for tiles is "textures/tiles.png" the engine wl process this as "tiles.png"
	- only embedded tilesets supported for now.
	- tile rendeirng issues, refer to original code ?
	- ensure tmx layer names are unique for ALL maps.
	- when serializing, you have to serialize engine components and tags, engine does not do it for you and then manually update physicscomponents parent entity.
	- talk about nulltexture and nullsound and nullanimation, etc which is used on defaultconstructed components.
	-  that first state is automatically loaded and last state is automatically unloaded
	-  abouit registering tags and components
	- when creating widgets from lua, the theme needs to be the same as one from that script file.
	- Classes with seralization:
				- animationcomponent
					- animation
					- animationframe
				- enabledcomponent
				- physicscomponent
					- may need to update internal entity during deserialization
				- rendercomponent
				- transformcomponent
				- cameratag
			- statemachine

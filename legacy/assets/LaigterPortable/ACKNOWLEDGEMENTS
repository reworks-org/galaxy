             CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT


    Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
the two main principles guiding its drafting:

    * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
      of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
      users,
    * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
      it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
      intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
      both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.

The authors of the CeCILL-C (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[logiciel] L[ibre])
license are:

    Preamble

The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the
right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license. 

The exercising of this right is conditional on the obligation to make
available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the
software so as to contribute to its evolution. 

In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability
of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the
security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to
use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be
freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no
provisions are either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

      6.1 OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE

The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or
all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms
and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work
and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the
distribution of said Initial Software.

The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at
least by the current license, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2.


      6.2 OVER THE INTEGRATED CONTRIBUTIONS

A Licensee who develops an Integrated Contribution is the owner of the
intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by 
applicable law. 


      6.3 OVER THE RELATED MODULES

A Licensee who develops an Related Module is the owner of the
intellectual property rights over this Related Module as defined by
applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall
govern its distribution under the conditions defined in Article 5.3.3.


      6.4 NOTICE OF RIGHTS

The Licensee expressly undertakes:

   1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property
      notices attached to the Software;
   2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies
      of the Software modified or not;
   3. to ensure that use of the Software, its intellectual property 
      notices and the fact that it is governed by the Agreement is 
      indicated in a text that is easily accessible, specifically from 
      the interface of any Derivative Software. 

The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the
intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the
Software and to take, where applicable, vis-ï¿½-vis its staff, any and all
measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights
of the Holder and/or Contributors.


    Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES

7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.

However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
shall incur liability therefor.

7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
and the Licensee.


    Article 8 - LIABILITY

8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.

8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
(i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
any or all compensation from the Licensor.


    Article 9 - WARRANTY

9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
reserved for experienced users.

The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order,
and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or
properties.

9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
rights set forth in Article 5).

9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant 
nature.

Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.

9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
of a trademark.


    Article 10 - TERMINATION

10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
remained ineffective.

10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
with the terms and conditions hereof.


    Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS


      11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS

Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to
perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force
majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective
functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications
networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by
government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke
one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be
interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to
invoke said provision(s) subsequently.

11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same
purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said
Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the
terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties
unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized
representatives.

11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not
cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.


      11.5 LANGUAGE

The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions
are deemed authentic.


    Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT

12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this
Agreement.

12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is
protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who
reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the
Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may
address new issues encountered by Free Software.

12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement
may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the
Agreement or a subsequent version.


    Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to
endeavor to seek an amicable solution to any disagreements or disputes
that may arise during the performance of the Agreement.

13.2 Failing an amicable solution within two (2) months as from their
occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the
disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having
jurisdiction, by the more diligent Party.

Introduction
============

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license.  The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of  free software in  commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation  that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with  or without modifications, in commercial products.  We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

Finally, many people asked us for  a preferred form  for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:
    Ã¢â¬ÅPortions of this software are copyright ÃÂ©  The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved."

  Please replace  with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.

Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------
Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.  This program is referred to as `a program  using the FreeType engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.

The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------
THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------
This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.  The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us.  However, no fee need be paid to us.

3. Advertising
--------------
Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.  However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only  this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.  Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
    o freetype@nongnu.org
Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public License without this special exception.

PCRE:

PCRE LICENSE
------------

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" license, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

- update loading screen spinny icon to be animated
Include-What-You-Use.
add to lua:
- https://github.com/skaarj1989/entt-meets-sol2
 Linux Support.
Sandbox tests to do:
- Components
- Graphics
- Scripting
- Systems
- UI
- assets should be per scene
- convert system to update thread/render thread/etc
- mainthread + render thread
- asset loading in threads
- https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/Crash-Course:-entity-component-system#dependencies
- support content scale (dpi thingy) for rml
- make sure font dpi is working with the content scale.
- state based system for character moevement + updating animation.
- thread for resource/processing? maybe? for loading of assets
- render thread architecture
CODE REVIEW TODO:
- GRAPHICS.

TODO: PORT REMAINING LEGACY CODE.

4 cores minimum then threads:
1x main thread
1x render thread
1x audio thread

1x io (resource) thread that then goes to 1x job system <-> misc tasks

-- LEGACY TODO BELOW --

encode output of json
- helps limit file size.
- convert to base64 then zlib.

- set camera keys
- ensure tests are up to date.

- some resource managers unique to a scene?
    - audio encapsulation / scene integration
    - since its threaded

3D:
- Ogre-Next

- custom 2d solution using vulkan or opengl. probably opengl.
- think aboot switching to sdl2
- use entt
- use librocket
- use imgui

replace contains with C++23 contains OR use ranges

    -  in docs that when adding folder to the config file they must have a '/' on the end if they are folders.
    -  about objects and physics in tmxmap docs with name of object being script name.
    -  about entt destroying components and to not allocate memory using components
    -  in docs that when making text objects in map, text fontfamily and size must be in fontbook in format: fontfamilySize and that parse code will remove spaces first.
        - and size is pixelsize not pointsize
    - and about the layer for objects being explictitly specified in properites of layer.
    -  that the engine operates on degrees, but allegro draws in radians.
    -  about layerrs and tmx mpa
    -  aboutt physics objects only being created if layreri s named collision, also note that it doesnt matter where textrues and stuff in tmx path too because only the last file name in the path is used.
        - i.e. if in tmx map the path for tiles is "textures/tiles.png" the engine wl process this as "tiles.png"
    - only embedded tilesets supported for now.
    - tile rendeirng issues, refer to original code ?
    - ensure tmx layer names are unique for ALL maps.
    - when serializing, you have to serialize engine components and tags, engine does not do it for you and then manually update physicscomponents parent entity.
    - talk about nulltexture and nullsound and nullanimation, etc which is used on defaultconstructed components.
    -  that first state is automatically loaded and last state is automatically unloaded
    -  abouit registering tags and components
    - when creating widgets from lua, the theme needs to be the same as one from that script file.
    - Classes with seralization:
                - animationcomponent
                    - animation
                    - animationframe
                - enabledcomponent
                - physicscomponent
                    - may need to update internal entity during deserialization
                - rendercomponent
                - transformcomponent
                - cameratag
            - statemachine

- add support to writing to update archives
- add entity heirachy. i.e. u can attach entities to each other. This can then be saved as a prefab
	- scene heirarchy / scene tree thingy?
- refine exporting, asset config, etc.
- great blog: https://pvigier.github.io/2019/07/28/vagabond-2d-light-system.html

- test particle generator

TileMap:
	loading a map should generate prefabs and store them.
	we can then on the fly create new entities from these prefabs.
	I.e. load all data beforehand and just assign/copy into a component.
	worldspace/tilemap transitions/loadings separate from loader.
	add load screen when switching maps in scene.
	maps now no longer render tiles, rather we pre-render a scene -> animated tiles are different / separate objects.
		prerendering lets us to fancy lighting and stuff.
		i.e. create tilemap in tiled, then export to use as bg image.

fix no ambient light when no lights in scene
add instance rendering
more flexible renderer -> able to render arbitrary stuff by having some prebaked quads and stuff.
	 - implement b2_debugdraw?
